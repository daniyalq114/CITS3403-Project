  <h1>What is LugiAnalytics?</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Welcome to LugiAnalytics</strong> — the ultimate replay analyzer for competitive Pokémon Showdown players. Just enter your Showdown username, share your team via a Pokepaste link, and paste your battle replay URLs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ll automatically extract key metrics—win/loss results, opponent teams, ELO shifts, move usage, and overall team performance—and transform them into clear, interactive charts and summaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use these insights to review your match history, fine‑tune your strategies, and dominate every battle. Our sleek UI is crafted in Figma, powered by an HTML parser that brings your replays to life.
